# introduction

## why ansible?

automating manual steps, upgrading tools, performing migration, performing security audits, provisioning, configuration management, continuous delivery, application deployment and security compliance  -> automating a certain set(repetitive) of steps

Workarounds to reduce repetitive steps? 

* Scripts -> requires time, coding skills, maintenance 

Simple solution -> use Ansible(simple, powerful and agent-less)
