# Loki

- **Log Aggregation** -> designed to store and **query logs**
- **Cost effective** + **easy to operate**
- Does not **index** full text from logs (like Elasticsearch)
  - Only **indexes labels** (metadata) from **logs**
  - Makes it more **cost effective** and **performant**
- Configuration and **query** language similar to **Prometheus**

Note:

- Elasticsearch -> Complex to handle ; Need a dedicated engineer to handle elasticsearch.
